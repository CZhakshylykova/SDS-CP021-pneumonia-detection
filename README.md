## 2. Clone the Repository
After forking the repository:
1. Open a terminal on your local machine.  
2. Clone your forked repository by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

## 3. Create a virtual environment
Setup a virtual environment to isolate project dependancies
1. Run the following command in the terminal to create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment
  - On a mac/linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  - On a windows:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Verify the virtual environment is active (the shell prompt should show (.venv))

## 4. Install dependancies
Install the required libraries for the project
1. Run the following command in the terminal to isntall dependancies from the requirements.txt file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
Once the setup is complete, you can proceed with building your project
